This is a jupyter notebook. The notebook consists of text and code cells.
Each code cell can be run by clicking on the cell (gray box), before clicking the

The code cells contain small programs written in the programming language Python.
We are going to use these programs for simulating nerve cell activity.

This computing lab consists of a virtual laboratory,
where we are going to stimulate a nerve cell with a sharp electrode.
We want to know how the membrane potential changes when we inject current into the cell.
Our goal is to understand how electric signals evolve over space and time in a neuron.

The experiments will be simulated with the modeling tools [LFPy](lfpy.github.io) and [NEURON](neuron.yale.edu).
These tools will divide the neuron into multiple compartments and represent each compartment by an electric circuit.
FIGURE: [./figures/multicomp.pdf, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8]
Then, the membrane potential can be calculated by solving the cable equation in each compartment:

$C_m \frac{\partial V_m(x, t)}{\partial t} = \frac{E_m - V_m(x, t)}{R_m} + \frac{d}{4 R_i} \frac{\partial^2 V_m}{\partial x^2}$

This equation is derived from the fact that the sum of the current going into
one compartment equals the sum of the current going out of the compartment.
In words, the cable equation says that the membrane potential at a specific point in space and time in a neuron depends on the following factors:
* the resistance of the cell membrane ($R_m$)
* the resistance of the cytoplasm ($R_i$)
* the diameter of the cell ($d$)
* the capacitance of the cell membrane ($C_m$)
* the resting membrane potentential ($E_m$)
* the membrane potential in the neighbor compartments ($V_m(x =$ position of left neighbor$)$, $V_m(x =$ position of right neighbor$)$)

The [----] separates ions in the cytoplasm from the extracellular fluids.
The separation of charge generates an electric voltage over the cell membrane.
This voltage is called the [----] and is measured in the unit of [----].

===== Exercise: Injecting current into passive dendrite =====
Now we are going to simulate an electrophysiology experiment during which an
electrode injects electric current into a part of a neuron.

We are going to study how this current injection affects the membrane potential.
In order to visualize the difference between active and passive ion channels,
we are going to start by simulating a part of a neuron with passive ion channels only.
You can think of this as a part of a passive dendrite.
A passive dendrite can be compared to a leaky water hose: similiar to water leaking out of the
holes in the water hose, electric currents will "leak out" of the passive ion channels.

Run the code cell below, in order to make python functions that can simulate the
neural activity in the dendrite and plot the results.

===== Exercise: How does the membrane potential spread through a passive cable? =====
Now we are going to look at how the membrane potential spreads spatially in our passive dendrite.
Run the code cell below, to make an interactive simulation showing the membrane potential ($V$)
as function of location ($x$).

Here, we inject a $0.3$ nA current lasting $10$ ms.

Change the timepoint shown in the figure by using the slider in one of the following ways:
* Drag the slider with the cursor
* Click on the slider, and move it with the arrow-keys
* Double-click on the number to the left of the slider and type in your chosen timepoint.

Where (for which x-location on the axon) does the membrane potential reach the highest value? When does this happen?

How do you think the membrane potential $V(x)$-graph will look if the elecrode is moved to the middle of the axon?

!bc pycod
Svar:
!ec

You can change the electrode location by changing the following line in the code cell above:

`input_locs = [0.]`

The number inside the square brackets gives the x-position of the electrode. Change this so that the electrode is placed on the middle of the axon:

`input_locs = [500.]`

Run the code cell and discuss with a fellow student: Does the simulation match your assumptions? Explain why/ why not. If the simulation result didn't match your assumption, change your answer above.

===== Exercise: How does the dendrite diameter affect the membrane potential? =====
In this exercise we are going to stimulate two dendrites:
one dendrite with diameter $d = 2~\mu m$ and a thicker dendrite
with diameter $d = 4 \mu m$. The injected current lasts $10$ ms and has an amplitude of $0.3$ nA.

Before running the simulation, answer the following: Will increasing the diameter make the membrane potential decay slower or more rapidly with distance from input location?

How does the membrane potential in the thick dendrite differ from the membrane potential in the thin dendrite?
Which changes could be done to our experiment, in order to make the membrane potential response look more similar for the two different dendrites?
!bc pycod
Answer:
!ec


!esubex

Change the amplitude of the current injected into the thick dendrite,
to make orange $V(x)$-curve more similar to the blue one.

You can do this by changing the very last number in the following line:
`axon_thick, stim_electrodes2 = simulate_cell(morphology_thick, [0.], i_dur = 10, i_amp=.3)`
such that
`i_amp = ` some number between 0 and 1.

!bsubex
Why did you have to increase/decrease the input current into the thick axon in order to get similar membrane potential amplitudes?

!bc pycod
Answer:
!ec

!bsol
about the same for i_amp = 0.82 nA.
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
Now that the amplitudes of the V(x)-curves for the thin (blue) and the thick (orange) dendrites are more similar, compare the shapes of the two curves. Explain the difference using the terms *resistance of the cell membrane (R_m)* and *inner resistance of the cytoplasm (R_i)*. Does this explanation agree with your answer in exercise 4a? If not, change your answer in 4a.

===== Exercise: Active cable =====

The distance between two nodes of ranvier can be up to $1.5$ mm.
Would you say that an action potential is shorter tan or longer than the distance between two Ranvier nodes?

!bc pycod
Answer:
!ec

!bsol
By using the slider you can see that more than $1.5$ mm of the axon will have an action potential above -55mV. This means that the action potential has a spatial reach that is longer than the distance between two nodes of Ranvier.

By adding a second electrode, we can stimulate the axon at two locations at the same time.

What happens when two action potentials meet?
!bc pycod
Answer:
!ec
!esubex


Add another electrode to the simulation, such that we stimulate the axon at two locations at the same time,
by changing the code lines setting the input locations and the delays.

´input_locs = [0., 1500.]´
´delays = [20., 20.]´

Here, `input_locs` decides where the electrodes are placed on the axon.
`delays` decides the time point when the corresponding electrode should give an electric input.
Meaning that the code above inserts two electrodes:
* One electrode at location $x = 0 \mu$m which injects an electric current after 20 ms.
* One electrode at location $x = 1500 \mu$m which also injects a current after 20 ms.

Run the code cell and use the slider to check whether your answer above is correct.

# # Instead of building the morphology yourself, you will in this example work with
# # anatomically reconstructed neuron models, which you can find in the cells-folder.
# # We start by simulating the Mainen and Sejnowski neuron model,
# # which is a layer-5 pyramidal cell from cat visual cortex. For more details, see
# # "Mainen and Sejnowski 1996": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8684467".
