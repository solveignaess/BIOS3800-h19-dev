This will make it easier for the current to flow inside of the dendrite, compared to leaking out through the membrane. Eventually, all the extra, positive charges injected by the current will leak out of the dendrite into the extracellular medium. In a thicker dendrite, more current will spread through the dendrite and escape into the extracellular medium further away from the electrode. This means that injecting current into a thick dendrite will have a larger effect on the membrane potential in the parts of the dendrite further away from the injection site (since more current will flow inside of the dendrite to these neighboring parts, instead of immediately escaping the cell). While in a thin dendrite, most of the current will escape the cell very close to the injection site, meaning that less current will enter the other parts of the dendrite, leading to a steeper decay in membrane potential as a function of distance from the input electrode.\n",

A thick dendrite with twice as large diameter as a thin dendrite, will therefore have 50% of the membrane resistance and only 25% of the inner resistance of the thin dendrite!

    "A graded potential decays exponentially with distance. Spatial summation refers to when two synapses placed on different locations on a neuron, are placed close enough for the graded potentials from the two synapses to \"meet\" and depolarize the same part of the membrane at the same time. When two such synapses receive input at roughly the same time point, some part of the neuron will experience more depolarization, than what could have been caused by a single synapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "One single synaptic input is normally not enough to bring the membrane potential in the soma up to threshold. Many synapses receiving input at roughly the same time can by spatial summation cause a stronger depolarization in the soma and lead to an action potential.\n",
