This computing lab consists of a virtual laboratory,
where we are going to stimulate a nerve cell with a sharp electrode.
We want to know how the membrane potential changes when we inject current into the cell.
Our goal is to understand how electric signals evolve over space and time in a neuron.

The experiments will be simulated with the modeling tools [LFPy](lfpy.github.io) and [NEURON](neuron.yale.edu).
These tools will divide the neuron into multiple compartments and represent each compartment by an electric circuit.
FIGURE: [./figures/multicomp.pdf, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8]
Then, the membrane potential $V_n$ can be calculated by solving the cable equation for compartment number $n$:


$C_m \frac{dV_n}{dt} = \frac{V_{n+1} - V_n}{R_i} - \frac{V_n - V_{n-1}}{R_i} + \frac{E_m - V_n}{R_m}$
#$C_m \frac{\partial V_m(x, t)}{\partial t} = \frac{E_m - V_m(x, t)}{R_m} + \frac{d}{4 R_i} \frac{\partial^2 V_m}{\partial x^2}$

This equation is derived from the fact that the sum of the current going into
one compartment equals the sum of the current going out of the compartment.
In words, the cable equation says that the membrane potential in compartment number $n$ in a neuron depends on the following factors:
* the resistance of the cell membrane, $R_m$, measured in Ohms ($\Omega$)
* the resistance of the cytoplasm $R_i$, measured in Ohms ($\Omega$)
* the diameter of the cell $d$, measured in meters (m)
* the capacitance of the cell membrane $C_m$, measured in Farads (F)
* the resting membrane potentential $E_m$, measured in volts (V)
* the membrane potential in the neighbor compartments $V_{n+1}$ and $V_{n-1}$, measured in volts (V).

===== Exercise: Injecting current into passive dendrite =====
Now we are going to simulate an electrophysiology experiment during which an
electrode injects electric current into a part of a neuron.

We are going to study how this current injection affects the membrane potential.
In order to visualize the difference between active and passive ion channels,
we are going to start by simulating a part of a neuron with passive ion channels only.
This means that there are **no voltage-gated ion channels** in this simulation.
You can think of this as a part of a passive dendrite.
A passive dendrite can be compared to a leaky water hose: similiar to water leaking out of the
holes in the water hose, electric currents will "leak out" of the passive ion channels.

Run the code cell below, in order to make python functions that can simulate the
neural activity in the dendrite and plot the results.

Answer:

!bsol
At rest, there is a higher concentration of positive ions outside of the cell as compared to inside of the cell, separated by the cell membrane. Sending a positive current into the cell can be thought of as sending positive charges into the cell. This will increase the concentration of positive ions inside of the cell, the charge difference between the inside and the outside of the cell will be reduced and the voltage over the cell membrane will be less positive. In other words, the cell membrane will be depolarized.

Since the cell membrane works as a (parallel plate) capacitor, we can think of injecting current into the cell as decharging the membrane capacitor, leading to a smaller voltage drop over the membrane capacitor.

Answer:

!bsol
After the electric current injection, the membrane potential will be larger than the membrane resting potenital. This will lead to a net movement of positive charge from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell, until the membrane resting potential is restored. (You can think of this as the cell getting rid of the positive charges injected by the electrode.) This transportation of charges happens through the passive ion channels, and is a process that takes a bit of time.

Now we are going to look at how the membrane potential spreads spatially in our passive dendrite.
Run the code cell below, to make an interactive simulation showing the membrane potential ($V$)
as function of location ($x$).

Here, we inject a $0.3$ nA current lasting $10$ ms.

Change the timepoint shown in the figure by using the slider in one of the following ways:
* Drag the slider with the cursor
* Click on the slider, and move it with the arrow-keys

The membrane potential reaches the highest value at location $x = 0 \mu$m at time point $30$ ms. In other words, the membrane will be charged the most at the last point in time when the electrode is injecting current, at the exact location where the electrode is injecting current.

You can change the electrode location by changing the following line in the code cell above:

`input_locs = [0.]`

The number inside the square brackets gives the x-position of the electrode. Change this so that the electrode is placed on the middle of the axon:

`input_locs = [500.]`

Run the code cell and discuss with a fellow student: Does the simulation match your assumptions? Explain why/ why not. If the simulation result didn't match your assumption, change your answer above.

How does the membrane potential in the thick dendrite differ from the membrane potential in the thin dendrite?

!bsol
When injecting the same current into a thin and a thick dendrite, the membrane potential in the thin dendrite will be more depolarized than the membrane potential in the thick dendrite. We could inject more current into the thick dendrite, in order to make the membrane potential response more similar for the two dendrites.
!esol

Change the amplitude of the current injected into the thick dendrite,
to make orange $V(x)$-curve more similar to the blue one.

You can do this by changing the very last number in the following line:

`axon_thick, stim_electrodes2 = simulate_cell(morphology_thick, [0.], i_dur = 10, i_amp=.3)`

such that `i_amp = ` <linebreak>
some number between 0 and 1.

Why did you have to increase/decrease the input current into the thick dendrite in order to get similar membrane potential amplitudes?

!bsol
!bsol
When increasing the amplitude of the current injected into the thick dendrite to `i_amp = 0.82 nA`, we get similar membrane potential amplitudes for the thin and the thick dendrite. A thicker dendrite has a larger cell membrane, which means that the membrane capacitance will be larger, and we need more current to charge a large capacitor, compared to a small capacitor. A thicker cell will also have a lower membrane resistance and a lower axial resistance. This means that it is easier for the current to escape, and it is harder to generate a difference in charge concentration.

Now that the amplitudes of the V(x)-curves for the thin (blue) and the thick (orange) dendrites are more similar, compare the shapes of the two curves. Give a short explanation of the difference. Do your results agree with your assumptions in 4a?

Answer:
!eblock

!bsol
Increasing the dendrite diameter will decrease the inner resistance of the dendrite. (The membrane resistance will also be reduced, but not as much as the inner resistance.) This will make it easier for the current to flow inside of the dendrite, compared to leaking out through the membrane. Eventually, all the extra, positive charges injected by the current will leak out of the dendrite into the extracellular medium. In a thicker dendrite, more current will spread through the dendrite and escape into the extracellular medium further away from the electrode. This means that injecting current into a thick dendrite will have a larger effect on the membrane potential in the parts of the dendrite further away from the injection site (since more current will flow inside of the dendrite to these neighboring parts, instead of immediately escaping the cell). While in a thin dendrite, most of the current will escape the cell very close to the injection site, meaning that less current will enter the other parts of the dendrite, leading to a steeper decay in membrane potential as a function of distance from the input electrode.
# The membrane potential decays more rapidly with distance from the input electrode in a thin dendrite, than in a thick dendrite. The membrane resistance ($R_m$) is inversely proportional to the diameter of the dendrite ($R_m \propto \frac{1}{d}$), while the inner resistance ($R_i$) is proportional to the square of the diameter ($R_i \propto \frac{1}{d^2}$). A thick dendrite with twice as large diameter as a thin dendrite, will therefore have 50% of the membrane resistance and only 25% of the inner resistance of the thin dendrite! This means that it will be relatively easier for the current to flow inside the cell than to leak out through the passive ion channels. In a thin dendrite most of the current will leak out of the

An action potential is regenerative, and can propagate down axons (in space) without any loss of shape or amplitude. A graded potential, on the other hand, will decay exponentially as a function of distance from current input (or synaptic input), since there are no active ion channels regenerating the signal.

While the action potential lasts a few milliseconds, a graded potential takes much longer to decay back to the resting membrane potential. The opening of active ion channels during an action potential will make the cell membrane more permeable (easier for ions to go through), which leads to faster restoring of the resting membrane potential. During a graded potential no active ion channels are open, and the only way for the ions to flow through the membrane is through the passive channels. Due to fewer open ion channels, the cell membrane is less permeabel during a graded potential, and it will take longer time for the ions to leak through the membrane and restore the resting membrane potential.

By adding a second electrode, we can stimulate the axon at two locations at the same time.

What happens when two action potentials meet?
!bc
!ec
!bblock
Answer:
!eblock
!bc
!ec

Add another electrode to the simulation, such that we stimulate the axon at two locations at the same time,
by changing the code lines setting the input locations and the delays.

`input_locs = [0., 1500.]`

`delays = [20., 20.]`

Here, `input_locs` decides where the electrodes are placed on the axon.
`delays` decides the time point when the corresponding electrode should give an electric input.
Meaning that the code above inserts two electrodes:
* One electrode at location $x = 0 \mu$m which injects an electric current after 20 ms.
* One electrode at location $x = 1500 \mu$m which also injects a current after 20 ms.

Run the code cell and use the slider to check whether your answer above is correct.

!bsol
By running the simulation below and using the slider, we can see that two action potentials will annihilate each other when they meet. A part of an axon that just regenerated an action potential will not be ready to fire a new action potential before the $\text{Na}^+$-gates have been reset to their resting positions, i.e until the absolute refractory period is over.

!bsol
After generating an action potential by injecting a current pulse into the cell, another equal current pulse can only result in another action potential with the same amplitude as the first one, if we wait with the second input current until both the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period have passed. Since we don't know how long the absolute refractory period is, we cannot compute the exact duration of the relative refractory period.

By running the simulation below, we find that we need to wait $\sim 14$~ms before injecting the second current, in order to generate two action potentials with the same amplitude. This means that the relative refractory period is finished after about $14$~ms.

Give a short explanation of the term "temporal summation".

!bc
!ec
!bblock
Answer:
!eblock
!bc

!bsol
Graded potenitals sum linearly. This means that if two graded potentials overlap in time and space, we get the total membrane potential by summing the two graded potentials. Temporal summation refers to when a single synapse receives inputs that are so close in time that the graded potential from the first input has not decayed all the way down to the resting membrane potential when the second input occurs. This way the membrane potential already has a head start when the second one occurs, and two (or more) graded potentials that are close in time can depolarize the cell membrane more than what one single input can do.


One single synaptic input is normally not enough to bring the membrane potential in the soma up to threshold. A burst of inputs to one single synapse can by spatial summation lead to an action potential.

A graded potential decays exponentially with distance. Spatial summation refers to when two synapses placed on different locations on a neuron, are placed close enough for the graded potentials from the two synapses to "meet" and depolarize the same part of the membrane at the same time. When two such synapses receive input at roughly the same time point, some part of the neuron will experience more depolarization, than what could have been caused by a single synapse.

One single synaptic input is normally not enough to bring the membrane potential in the soma up to threshold. Many synapses receiving input at roughly the same time can by spatial summation cause a stronger depolarization in the soma and lead to an action potential.
